This essay examines the contradictory urges of modernization and de-development in rural Manchukuo. One of the ideas I wanted to explore was the difference between the manifestations of capitalism such as cash cropping and commodity production and the transition into a "capitalist" class structure. This question is important when discussing the history of Japanese empire as one of the awkward truths is that Japan did in fact develop industry and infrastructure in its territories to an extent, unlike European imperialism. My work squares this circle and avoids falling into both imperialist apologia and a reductive view of the history which overlooks the genuine developmental effects of Japanese rule, which later led Manchuria to become the main industrial base of the People's Republic.

I argue that despite modernizing urges by Japanese and Manchurian Chinese rulers, the Manchukuo government was highly dependent on feudal landlords in the countryside to maintain rule. While the Japanese were unhappy with this arrangement, they had no real ability to maintain governance of the country without them and as such were structurally unable to implement agrarian reform. This, alongside increasingly brutal wartime grain requisitions, created a policy of simultaneous rural savagery and brutality and urban military-industrial developmentalism.
