## Summary 

The paper claims to provide a polynomial-time algorithm for solving the NP-complete problem 3-SAT. In examining the paper’s argument, we find a flaw in one of the main sections of its algorithm. We argue that this flaw causes the paper’s algorithm to incorrectly decide that an infinite family of satisfiable 3-CNF boolean formulas are not satisfiable. Therefore, the paper does not establish that P = NP.
