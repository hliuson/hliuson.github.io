One of the questions which interested me while studying colonial Latin American history was how the Spanish empire was able to conquer such vast swathes of territory with a small force. This led me to write about the role of native elites within the Spanish Empire. I focus on the Andean region, where native elites (particularly in Cuzco) maintained a relatively strong presence vis-a-vis Mesoamerica, and study their evolution over time by focusing on two main points in time: the immediate aftermath of the conquests, and the Tupac Amaru rebellion near the end of the colonial period. I argue that over time the native aristocracy and nobility largely assimilated, if not literally by marriage, then at least in terms of colonial interests, with the Spanish creole elites by the end of the period. This shift follows the long-term development of a commercial economy in the Andean region.
