# About
I am a 4th year student at the University of Rochester, majoring in Computer Science and History with a minor in Mathematics. I am currently working with Jianxun Lian at Microsoft Research Asia on adapting LLMs for roleplay tasks, which you can read about [here](/posts/low-param-soft-prompt/).

At the University of Rochester I have had the privilege of working with Professors Lane Hemaspaandra, Chris Kanan, and PhD students Michael C. Chavrimootoo (Now professor) and Jhair Gallardo.

I am interested in creating powerful systems capable of navigating a wide range of scenarios and problems. I think this problem can be decomposed into two parts: model capability and our ability to elicit and control that capability. To develop capability, I am interested synthetic data via methods which combine machine learning models with symbolic or programmatic methods. To develop interpretability and control, I am interested in mechanistic methods which can develop interpretable embedddings.

Some papers which interest me are:
 - [AlphaProof](https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/ai-solves-imo-problems-at-silver-medal-level/) and [DeepSeek-Prover-V1.5](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.08152)
 - [Eureka](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12931).
 - [Scaling Monosemanticity](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2024/scaling-monosemanticity/index.html)
 - [Adverserial Skill Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.01906).


 Outside of computer science, I am interested in history with a focus on political economy and imperialism. You can find some of my writings [here](/tags/history).
