# About
I am a 4th year student at the University of Rochester, majoring in Computer Science and History with a minor in Mathematics. I am currently working with [Jianxun Lian](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/jialia) on adapting LLMs for roleplay tasks, which you can read about [here](/posts/low-param-soft-prompt/).

Some topics and ideas which interest me, and relevant papers:
 - Grounding LLMs with an external source-of-truth or verifier ([AlphaProof](https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/ai-solves-imo-problems-at-silver-medal-level/), [DeepSeek-Prover-V1.5](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.08152)).
 - Mechanistic interpretability and steering using sparse autoencoders ([Scaling Monosemanticity](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2024/scaling-monosemanticity/index.html), [Prism](https://thesephist.com/posts/prism/)).

 Outside of computer science, I am interested in history with a focus on political economy and imperialism. You can find some of my writings [here](/categories/history).
