# About Me
I am a Masters student at the University of Michigan. I currently am working on state representation and goal discovery in reinforcement learning with Professor [Silviu Pitis](https://silviupitis.com/).

I graduated in May 2025 from the University of Rochester with a BS in Computer Science and a BA in History. At the University of Rochester I worked with Lane Hemaspaandra and Michael C. Chavrimootoo on the computational complexity of elections under voting rule uncertainty. I also coauthored two critique papers which debunked preprints which claimed to resolve the P=NP question.
 - [Evaluating the Claims of "SAT Requires Exhaustive Search"](/posts/xu-zhou-critique)
 - [A Critique of Du's "A Polynomial-Time Algorithm for 3-SAT"](/posts/du-3sat-critique)

I additionally worked with Chris Kanan and Jhair Gallardo on training neural networks without backpropagation.

I interned at Microsoft Research Asia in the summer of 2024 working under Jianxun Lian on adapting LLMs for roleplay tasks with extremely few data examples, which you can read about here: [Low-Parameter Soft-Prompt Learning for Behavioral Adaptation in LLMs](/posts/low-param-soft-prompt/). 

My study in history concentrated on topics of political economy, imperialism, and class formation.
