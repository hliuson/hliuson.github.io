# About Me
I am a 4th year student at the University of Rochester, majoring in Computer Science and History with a minor in Mathematics. I am currently working with Jianxun Lian at Microsoft Research Asia on adapting LLMs for roleplay tasks, which you can read about here: [Low-Parameter Soft-Prompt Learning for Behavioral Adaptation in LLMs](/posts/low-param-soft-prompt/).

At the University of Rochester I have had the privilege of working with Professors Lane Hemaspaandra, Chris Kanan, and PhD students Michael C. Chavrimootoo (Now professor) and Jhair Gallardo.

I published two critique papers on arXiv which debunked preprints which claimed to resolve the P=NP question.
 - [Evaluating the Claims of "SAT Requires Exhaustive Search"](/posts/xu-zhou-critique)
 - [A Critique of Du's "A Polynomial-Time Algorithm for 3-SAT"](/posts/du-3sat-critique)

### Misc    
 Outside of computer science, I am interested in history with a focus on political economy and imperialism. You can find some of my writings which discuss the role of particular local elites in imperialism here:
 - [Feudalism and Class Power in Rural Manchukuo](/posts/feudalism-manchukuo)
 - [Elite Convergence in the Colonial Andes](/posts/colonial-andes)
