# About
I am a 4th year student at the University of Rochester, majoring in Computer Science and History with a minor in Mathematics. I am currently working with Jianxun Lian at Microsoft Research Asia on adapting LLMs for roleplay tasks, which you can read about [here](/posts/low-param-soft-prompt/).

At the University of Rochester I have had the privilege working with Professors Lane Hemaspaandra, Chris Kanan, and PhD students Michael C. Chavrimootoo (Now professor) and Jhair Gallardo.

Some topics and ideas which interest me with relevant papers:
 - Incorporating LLMs into reinforcement learning. This may be training the LLM itself with aid of a symbolic verifier as a reward function, such as in [AlphaProof](https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/ai-solves-imo-problems-at-silver-medal-level/) and [DeepSeek-Prover-V1.5](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.08152), using LLMs to code reward functions for reinforcement learning agents as in [Eureka](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12931), or some variation on this theme.
 - Mechanistic interpretability and steering of language models using sparse autoencoders ([Scaling Monosemanticity](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2024/scaling-monosemanticity/index.html)).


 Outside of computer science, I am interested in history with a focus on political economy and imperialism. You can find some of my writings [here](/tags/history).
